# PXLoader
[![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/badge/pod-v1.0.0-blue.svg)]()

PXLoader provides a custom loader view with custom image animation.

# Integration

#### CocoaPods (iOS 8+)
You can use [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `PXTutorial` by adding it to your `Podfile`:
```ruby

platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
	pod â€˜PXLoader'
end
```
Note that this requires CocoaPods version [1.0.0](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases/tag/1.0.0) or later, and your iOS deployment target to be at least 8.0

## Building the module locally
The example project of this module should always compile locally when checking out the `master` or `develop` branch.
